# 🏋 Section 1: Lab Exercise

## 📌 Objective

This lab will guide you through **advanced word cloud visualisation** techniques before preparing you for two assignments:

1.	Topic Modeling with Wikipedia Articles
2.	PCA for Digit Classification

By the end of this lab, you should have a **deeper understanding of NLP techniques** and **dimensionality reduction**, enabling you to work on the assignments effectively.

## 📋 **Tasks**: 

### 🔹 Task 1: Generate a Simple Word Cloud
Before diving into **advanced word clouds**, ensure you can generate a **basic word cloud** from a text corpus.

✅ Steps:

-	Load a text dataset (e.g., a Wikipedia article or news text).
-	Remove stopwords, punctuation, and unnecessary symbols.
-	Convert the text into a word cloud image.


### 🔹 Task 2: Advanced Word Cloud Visualisation

Now, extend your basic word cloud by adding **complex features**:

✅ Steps:

1.Shape-Based Word Clouds
  
- Use a custom mask to generate a word cloud in a specific shape (e.g., a map of Vietnam, a book, or a speech bubble).
  
2.Frequency vs. TF-IDF Word Clouds

- Compare a regular frequency-based word cloud vs. a TF-IDF weighted word cloud.
-	Explain how TF-IDF gives more importance to unique words instead of commonly used ones.

3.Multi-Coloured & Themed Word Clouds

-	Use colour gradients to differentiate positive vs. negative words.
-	Create different word clouds for different topics in the same dataset.

4.Bigrams & Phrase-Based Word Clouds

-	Extract bigrams (two-word phrases) to include words like "Vietnam War" instead of separate words "Vietnam" and "War".

5.Compare Word Clouds Before & After Preprocessing

-	Generate one word cloud before text cleaning (including stopwords, symbols).
-	Generate another word cloud after applying lemmatisation & stopword removal.
-	Compare the differences and discuss why preprocessing improves visualisation.


### 🔹 Task 3: Understanding Topic Modeling & Dimensionality Reduction

Before working on the assignments, ensure you understand these **key concepts**:

📌 Topic Modeling (For Assignment 1)

- Topic modeling is used to discover hidden themes in large text data.
-	Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a popular method that groups words into topics based on co-occurrence patterns.
-	pyLDAvis helps visualise the topic distribution and important words per topic.

✅ Preparation Task:

-	Research how LDA works and how topics are extracted from documents.
-	Understand how the relevance slider (λ) in pyLDAvis helps refine word selection for each topic.

---

📌 Dimensionality Reduction (For Assignment 2)

-	High-dimensional data (e.g., images or text embeddings) is difficult to visualise.
-	Principal Component Analysis (PCA) helps reduce dimensions while keeping important information.
- In the Digits dataset, PCA can transform 64-dimensional images into a 2D or 3D representation for easier classification.

✅ Preparation Task:

-	Research how PCA works and why it is useful for high-dimensional data.
-	Understand how explained variance helps determine how much information is retained after reducing dimensions.
-	Read about common misclassifications (e.g., why people confuse 1 and 7 in handwriting recognition).

# 🏋 Section 2: Lab Assignment

### 🗒️ NOTES:
1. ✅ **Before you start:** Complete the exercises in Week 4 Lab Exercise.  
2. 📤 **Submission:** Upload your Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file) to Canvas **before the end of this week**.
3. If you are a PhD student, you must work on both of the assignments and submit before the deadline, otherwise you have to submit at least one of the 2 assignments.

### 📌 Assignment Details

#### 🟡 Rules:

- 💬 The code must be fully commented.  
-	📝 Print all outputs so results are clearly visible.
-	🐍 Use appropriate libraries to complete the tasks. E.g. SpaCy.
-	🚫 Do not use NaN values—filter or replace missing data where necessary.
-	✅ Your final script should run without errors when executed.


#### 📂 Datasets:
Use the 🔗 [Amazon Fine Food Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews) dataset from Kaggle: Reviews.csv. Or you can access and download the dataset from this 🔗 [link](https://vinuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/22dang_kh_vinuni_edu_vn/EtnaG0444TBPgrrJTriAUKoBiN44H4UGs3QO1Uen6MSSxQ?e=nt9191)
